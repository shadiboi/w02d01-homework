// ### 1. Data types
// #### Refresher

// So far we have seen:

// * Strings
// * Numbers
// * Booleans
// * Arrays
// * Objects

// When these datatypes are combined, we get a **data structure**, for example, an array that contains objects that each contain booleans.

// Suppose you are tasked with creating some software, and it is up to **you** to determine which datatypes and what data structure to use.  For each of the following, write which **data types** you would use to represent the data, and then give a small example of the **data structure**:

//   * A light switch that can be either on or off.
                //Boolean
//   * A user's email address.
                //String
//   * A spaceship with a hull, laser blasters, tractor beam, and warp drive.
                // Object
//   * A list of student names from our class.
                //Array
//   * A list of student names from our class, each with a location.
                //Object
//   * A list of student names from our class, each with a location and each with a list of favorite tv shows.
                //Array & Object

// &#x1F534; **Commit:** "data types" //DONE

// ### 2. Take it Easy

// 1. Make an array that holds all of the colors of the rainbow.
const colorArray = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet'
]
// 2. Write code that will access "blue" from the rainbow array.
const blue = colorArray[4];

// 3. Make an object that is called your name and holds the information about your favorite food, a hobby, the name of the town that you live in currently, and your favorite datatype.
const me = {
    name: "Shadi",
    FavFood: "Ali Baba Grill",
    hobby: "gym",
    favDataType: Boolean
};


// 4. Write code that will access your hobby from the object that you just created.
const meHobby = me.hobby;
